First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```

### 2. Navigate into the project folder

Go to the project directory where the repository was cloned:

```bash
cd crm
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Now, install the required project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all necessary packages defined in `package.json`.

### 4. Set up environment variables (if needed)

If your project requires environment variables, create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the necessary variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your-api-url
```

### 5. Run the project locally

After installing dependencies, start the development server by running:

npm run dev
```

This will start the development server. You can view the app by opening a browser and navigating to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 6. View the application

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should now see the CRM application running in your local environment.

### 7. Build for production (optional)

If you want to build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Once the build is completed, start the production server with:

```bash
